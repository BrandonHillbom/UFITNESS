      One of the most challenging aspects to attaining one's fitness goals is 
      sticking to a program until until the end. We at UFitness completely understand 
      the dissapointment of not seeing your progress. However, we tend to only focus on 
      macroscopic properties rather than data that shows undeniable progress. Through 
      our fitness tracker, you will be able to see your improvement by tracking calorie 
      and protein intake, weight loss/gain, muscle growth, strength, and endurance! You 
      can also select foods that you eat throughout the day and we will automatically 
      calculate nutritional information for you!

    <h2>Nutrition Guide</h2>
    <div class = "main">
      Nothing is worse when trying to physically and mentally better yourself than when 
      you research what you should be eating and instead, you are given general servings 
      or meals that even Gordon Ramsey would struggle to cook! Our nutrition guide provides 
      you with meals and supplemental snacks that combine convenience, health, and taste 
      to give you exactly what you are looking for! There are also extensive resources and 
      information to help you create your own versions of these meals to ensure the nutritional 
      plan is working for you instead of you working for it.
