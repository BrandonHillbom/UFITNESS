                nutrition methods to achieve their goals. Most people fit into one
                of three body types: ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph. By identifying

                One of the most challenging aspects to attaining one's fitness goals is
                sticking to a program until until the end. We at UFitness completely understand
                the dissapointment of not seeing your progress. However, we tend to only focus on
                macroscopic properties rather than data that shows undeniable progress. Through
                our fitness tracker, you will be able to see your improvement by tracking calorie
                and protein intake, weight loss/gain, muscle growth, strength, and endurance! You
                can also select foods that you eat throughout the day and we will automatically
                calculate nutritional information for you!

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-10 col-md-8 mx-auto">
                Nothing is worse when trying to physically and mentally better yourself than when
                you research what you should be eating and instead, you are given general servings
                or meals that even Gordon Ramsey would struggle to cook! Our nutrition guide provides
                you with meals and supplemental snacks that combine convenience, health, and taste
                to give you exactly what you are looking for! There are also extensive resources and
                information to help you create your own versions of these meals to ensure the nutritional
                plan is working for you instead of you working for it.
