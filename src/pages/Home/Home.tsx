                    One of the most challenging aspects to attaining one's fitness goals is
                    sticking to a program until until the end. We at UFitness completely understand
                    the dissapointment of not seeing your progress. However, we tend to only focus on
                    macroscopic properties rather than data that shows undeniable progress. Through
                    our fitness tracker, you will be able to see your improvement by tracking calorie
                    and protein intake, weight loss/gain, muscle growth, strength, and endurance! You
                    can also select foods that you eat throughout the day and we will automatically
                    calculate nutritional information for you!

                    Nothing is worse when trying to physically and mentally better yourself than when
                    you research what you should be eating and instead, you are given general servings
                    or meals that even Gordon Ramsey would struggle to cook! Our nutrition guide provides
                    you with meals and supplemental snacks that combine convenience, health, and taste
                    to give you exactly what you are looking for! There are also extensive resources and
                    information to help you create your own versions of these meals to ensure the nutritional
                    plan is working for you instead of you working for it.
